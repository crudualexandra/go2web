# go2web

`go2web` is a Swift command-line tool created for the Web Programming laboratory work.  
The goal of the project is to implement a small CLI web client that can make manual HTTP requests, search the web, and display human-readable responses without using built-in or third-party HTTP client libraries.

## Progress

### Step 1 — Basic CLI argument parsing

In this step, the basic command-line interface was implemented using `CommandLine.arguments`.

Implemented options:

```bash
go2web -h
go2web -u <URL>
go2web -s <search-term>
```

Current behavior:
    •    -h prints the help message.
    •    -u <URL> accepts a URL and prints a placeholder message.
    •    -s <search-term> accepts one or multiple search words and prints a placeholder search message.
    •    Missing or unknown arguments are handled with error messages.
    
Tested commands:
```bash
swift run go2web -h
swift run go2web -u http://example.com
swift run go2web -s swift sockets tutorial
```

Result:
```bash
go2web — Command-line tool

Usage:
  go2web -h
  go2web -u <URL>
  go2web -s <search-term>
```

### Step 2 — Manual URL parsing

In this step, manual URL parsing was added for `http://` and `https://` addresses.

The parser extracts:

- scheme
- host
- port
- path

Default ports are selected automatically:

- `http` → port `80`
- `https` → port `443`

Tested commands:

```bash
swift run go2web -u http://example.com
swift run go2web -u http://example.com/test/page
swift run go2web -u "https://example.com/search?q=test"
```

Example result:
```bash
[go2web] Parsed URL:
  scheme: https
  host:   example.com
  port:   443
  path:   /search?q=test
```
At this stage, the program still does not make a real network request. The parsed URL will be used in the next step to build a raw HTTP request over TCP sockets.



### Step 3 — Raw HTTP GET over POSIX sockets

In this step, the `-u` command was connected to a real HTTP request implementation.

The program now:

- parses the URL;
- creates a TCP socket using POSIX socket functions;
- resolves the host with `getaddrinfo`;
- connects to the server using `connect`;
- manually builds an HTTP/1.1 `GET` request as text;
- sends the request using `send`;
- reads the raw server response using `recv`;
- separates the HTTP headers from the response body.

No HTTP client libraries are used. The implementation does not use `URLSession`, `URLRequest`, `Data(contentsOf:)`, Alamofire, or any third-party HTTP client.

Tested command:

```bash
swift run go2web -u http://example.com
```

Result:
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

<!doctype html><html lang="en"><head><title>Example Domain</title>...
```
At this stage, the response is still printed mostly raw. HTML cleaning and human-readable formatting will be implemented in the next step.


### Step 4 — Human-readable response formatting

In this step, raw HTTP responses were converted into human-readable output.

The program now:

- reads the `Content-Type` header;
- removes HTML tags from `text/html` responses;
- removes `script` and `style` blocks;
- decodes common HTML entities;
- pretty-prints JSON responses when the content type is `application/json`;
- handles `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` responses by removing chunk size markers before formatting the body.

Tested command:

```bash
swift run go2web -u http://example.com
```
Result:
```bash
Example Domain

This domain is for use in documentation examples without needing permission. Avoid use in operations.

This step satisfies the requirement that responses should be human-readable and not printed as raw HTML.


### Step 5 — HTTP redirect handling

In this step, HTTP redirect support was added.

The program now detects redirect status codes:

- `301`
- `302`
- `303`
- `307`
- `308`

When a redirect response is received, the program reads the `Location` header and follows the new address. Both absolute and relative redirect locations are supported. A maximum limit of 5 redirects is used to avoid infinite redirect loops.


### Step 6 — File-based HTTP cache

In this step, a simple file-based cache mechanism was added.

The program now creates a local folder named `.go2web-cache` in the current working directory. Successful GET responses are saved in this folder.

Each cache file stores:

- timestamp
- status code
- content type
- human-readable body

The cache TTL is 300 seconds. If the same URL is requested again within this time, the program reads the saved response from cache instead of making a new network request.


### Step 7 — Search command preparation

In this step, the `-s` command was prepared for web search.

The program now:

- accepts one or multiple words after `-s`;
- builds a DuckDuckGo HTML search URL;
- encodes spaces as `+`;
- includes a parser prepared for extracting the top 10 results from DuckDuckGo HTML;
- extracts result title, link, and snippet when HTML content is available;
- does not use external HTML parser libraries;
- does not use `URLSession`, `URLRequest`, `Data(contentsOf:)`, or HTTP client libraries.
At this stage, real search fetching is not active yet because the selected DuckDuckGo HTML endpoint requires HTTPS. The search parser is already implemented and will be used after HTTPS transport support is added.


### Step 8 — HTTPS transport support

In this step, HTTPS support was added using Apple `Network.framework`.

The program still does not use `URLSession`, `URLRequest`, `Data(contentsOf:)`, or any HTTP client library. The HTTP request is still manually constructed as a raw HTTP/1.1 text request. `Network.framework` is used only as the TLS transport layer for HTTPS connections.


### Step 9 — Search top 10 results

In this step, the -s command was completed.

The program now:
    •    builds the DuckDuckGo HTML search URL;
    •    sends the request over HTTPS;
    •    receives the HTML response;
    •    parses the result titles and links manually;
    •    prints the top 10 search results;
    •    does not use URLSession, URLRequest, Data(contentsOf:), or HTTP client libraries.
This satisfies the main laboratory requirement for go2web -s <search-term>.
### Step 10 — Open search results by number

In this step, the search results became accessible through the CLI.

After running a search, the program saves the top result URLs into `.go2web-last-search`.

The search command uses Bing HTML results because DuckDuckGo returned an anti-bot challenge page during testing. The program still performs a manual HTTPS request and parses the returned HTML without using an HTTP client library.
